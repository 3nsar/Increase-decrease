# Increase-decrease

This is a simple Increase-Decrease Webapp. 
You can increase and also decrease the given number.
For this webapp i used css, javascript and also html.
I created this webapp just to practice my DOM-Manipulation skills a little bit and i used also a media query just
to make it more responsive.
